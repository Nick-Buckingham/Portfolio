      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>
        I am 29 year old father of 2 and aspiring web developer. <br /> I am
        currently employed as a Carpenter at Kiefer Construction. <br /> I spend
        most of free time fishing, skateboarding, snowboarding, hanging out with
        friends and family, and practicing/researching software/ways to improve
        my developing skills. <br />I started attending Kenzie Acadamy as of
        February 2023 and since then have learned an array of skills to put into
        my arsenal to become a valuable asset to a development team.
      </p>
      <h2>Goals:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Break away from construction and get into the tech industry.</li>
        <li>
          Never stop growing and learning to become the best developer I can be.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be as efficient and clean as possible when it comes to writing code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prove to myself that if work hard and stay focused I can achieve
          anything.
        </li>
      </ul>
